Eat faster, the ice cream is going to melt!\
Still lots of ice cream left, come and get it.\
Still lots of ice cream left, come and get it.\
Still lots of ice cream left, come and get it.\
Still lots of ice cream left, come and get it.\
Still lots of ice cream left, come and get it.\
Still lots of ice cream left, come and get it.\
Ice cream is running low!\
Going once!\
Going twice!\
Gone!\
Life without ice cream isn't the same.
